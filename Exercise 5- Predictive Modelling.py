#1. Does it improve adjusted R2?
        #Removing each variable other than instagram or ezine improves adjusted R2.
#2. Does it have an insignificant p-value?
        # Each removed variable had an insignificant p-value
#3. Is it associated with response by itself?
        # None of the removed variables were strongly associated with the response variable
#4. Is it strongly associated with another explanatory variables? (If yes, then including
#       both may be redundant.)
        # Ezine and Instagram are not strongly associated with each other so including both is not an issue
#5. Does common sense say it should contribute to the model?
        # Common sense would say that any of these variables could or could not be included, so I will include the variables that make the most statistical sense
#6. What would you eliminate from the model?
        # I eliminated all variables except instagram and ezine because they had high p-values and decreased the adjusted R2

# We changed one extreme twitter outlier that was 78,000 or something to 0 because it made no sense and was heavily skewing the graph to make it impossible to read.

    # There is a clear difference for the West plot showing that as tweets increased, redbull sales in the West decreased.
